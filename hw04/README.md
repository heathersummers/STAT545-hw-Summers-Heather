### Report Your Process:
For the first part of the assignment about reshaping data I found it very helpful to create the cheatsheet at the beginning since I was able to refer to it while completing the second activity. I did not find it hard to shape the data in long and wide format and create the appropriate tables and figure. I am finding it much easier to create and manipulate the components of figures since that has been the focus of previous homework assignments.

For the second part of the assignment about joining I first created a cheatsheet with simple data in order to understand the four mutating joins (`left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, `full_join()`)and two filtering joins (`semi_join()` and `anti_join()`). I found the cheatsheet made it much easier for me to understand what each of the join functions was doing to the gapminder and air pollutant data frames. I did find it difficult initially to find data online that had the correct range of years, countries, and was in a format that was accessible to download. I did not find it difficult to manipulate the data to look similar to gapminder.
