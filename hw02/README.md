### Report Your Process:

While completing this assignment I encountered few to no frustrations with using R Markdown and GitHub which made the coding experience much more enjoyable than the first assignment. I encountered a few small issues every once in a while when I was generating the code for the section of the assignment entitled 'Exploring various plot types' but found Jenny's dplyr tutorial very helpful. If I still had troubles with a plot after consulting Jenny's document I usually searched the functions on the internet. I found creating the facet plot most challenging since there were several functions I had to look up in order to understand how to generate the plot. Although we haven't learned how to create stripplots in class I found creating those plots was fairly easy.
