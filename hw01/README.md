Hello, my name is ***Heather*** and I am from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada! I recently graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Science from the Integrated Science program at McMaster University with a biology concentration. I am an MSc student in the Department of Geography working under the supervision of Dr. Simon Donner. I will be pursuing research on climate change and the impact that it has on coral reef biomes. 

### Research Experience:memo:
During my undergraduate degree I had the opportunity to participate in a variety of field courses ranging from studying the unique geology and environment of Iceland, to the health of the coral reefs in the Caribbean, to the geology and hydrology of the karstic landscape in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, Mexico. During the summers of 2015 and 2016 I completed marine field research projects under the Operation Wallacea program where I learned about marine biodiversity and conservation management strategies. This past summer I worked as part of the Educational and Supervisory Science Staff for Operation Wallacea where I delivered reef ecology lectures and in-water practicals for high school and university students taking the reef ecology course on the Utila marine site in Honduras.

### Report your process
I found it very easy to edit the README.md and add different aspects of the Markdown syntax such as section headers, bold, bullet points, images, emojis, and quotes. I found this [link](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) very helpful in creating the emojis since it provided a complete list of github markdown emojis. At the start I edited locally and then pushed to github.com and then when I wanted to make small changes I would sometimes edit in the browser at github.com. However, I learned later on some of the issues that can arise if you don't pull the commits locally and had some difficulty merging the two versions. After having an issue merging information I completed the rest of the edits locally by saving the README.md file, commiting any changes to my repository, and then pushing the commit to github.com. I made all edits locally for the R Markdown document and did not find it difficult adding new plots or code.
